        <h1>From 'As I See It'</h1>

        <p class="author">by Douglas Harding</p>

        <h2>From 'How To Be Spontaneous'</h2>

        <p>The article under this heading, in the May ‘74 number of Self and Society, made me look afresh into
            the question of my own spontaneity, and what (for me) spontaneity really is, with the results that I shall
            try to summarise here. But first, the points in that article which started me off. Briefly, they were these:
        </p>
        <p>When someone annoys me, there are four possible levels of response. (1) The worst, I say nothing. (2)
            Slightly better, I blurt out: ‘You are a pain in the neck.’ (3) Better still, I say: ‘You
            give me a pain in the neck.’ (4) The best, I report: ‘When you did that, I felt a pain in the
            neck, etc.’ Here, at level 4, there intervenes a tiny pause, when my attention is turned inwards to
            find out how I am actually feeling. This (as I understand the article) enables me to act spontaneously, with
            my whole self, on the whole situation.
        </p>
        <p>I find there is a fifth possibility: I can notice that the pain I feel right here ‘in my neck’
            isn’t for me in a neck at all!
        </p>
        <p>In that place where others observe my neck to be, I find nothing of the sort. When I’m really
            attentive I find here nothing solid, or opaque, or pink or brown or black, or cylindrical, but just space—space
            in which these pains and tensions are coming and going. In fact, I have difficulty in locating them anywhere
            at all—let alone inside a column of flesh and blood and bone, about 6 inches in diameter—to be
            quite honest.
        </p>
        <p>Let me try to describe in more detail what I find happening at this fifth level:</p>
        <p>a) I notice that the situation as given, vis-a-vis that infuriating person, isn’t in fact symmetrical
            at all. It’s not a face-to-face or neck- to-neck confrontation, but neck-to-no-neck, face-there to
            no-face- here. I observe that, whether I like it or not, I’m wide open to and for him. Not on
            principle, not as a matter of policy, not in idea or feeling or imagination, but actually, in simple
            perception, I make way for him. I am room for him to be like that in. Right here, I find I’m built
            that way. Thomas Traherne puts it well:
        </p>
        <p>No brims nor borders in myself I see: My essence is Capacity.</p>
        <p>b) Seeing this total asymmetry, I find thoughts ceasing. There occurs here a kind of ‘alert idiocy’.
            My mind ‘goes blank’. I’m perfectly clueless about how to cope.
        </p>
        <p>c) Commonly, though not invariably, I find, along with this cluelessness, a kind of relaxation, in which my
            body is very alive but very still, and my breathing seems almost to cease altogether.
        </p>
        <p>d) I just wait and see. Or rather, see and wait: see how it is here and await what comes out. I respond to
            that annoying person unpredictably, in accordance with no plan or conscious level of behaviour: I have no
            preview of what I shall find myself doing or saying. I may (and very often do) keep silent, or turn tail, or
            tear strips off him, or even (though this is most unusual) treat him to an account of what he’s doing
            to my neck, etc., supposing I had one right here. Often I’m surprised, occasionally shocked, at what
            emerges.
        </p>
        <p>e) But whatever my reaction I find it can be trusted—provided I’m attending to where it comes
            from—this inner Emptiness or Clarity or Capacity. It turns out to be (so far as I can judge, with
            hindsight) the best response possible in the circumstances as a whole, appropriate to the total situation,
            and certainly never destructive or hating. (Conversely, to the extent that I imagine here a thing instead of
            no-thing, a solid face and neck to confront him with, I am rejecting him, shutting him out, telling him to
            keep off. My dishonest attempts to make the set-up symmetrical are a sort of hate—the very basis of
            all my personal-relationship problems—with the result that those problems get worse and worse).
        </p>
        <p>f) I may afterwards (but this is optional) attempt to explain to myself why this fifth level alone is, in
            my experience, truly spontaneous, creative, and workable. My explanation takes the following form:
            This Space, or boundless Capacity, which I find here (in which that person is doing annoying things and
            these pains and tensions are going on) is what I really am as 1st person singular, present tense: it is my
            inside story. It has, traditionally, many names, from which I may take my pick. They include: the Void, the
            Buddha Nature, Tao, Atman-Brahman, Being, Consciousness, the One, Spirit, Essence, the Source, one’s
            True and Original Face, the Single or Third Eye, the Kingdom within, the Light that lights every man, the
            Godhead, the eternal indwelling Christ—the names are many and varied, the fact is one and the same. I
            know it because I am it: it’s the one ‘thing’ I have inside knowledge of. Whatever label I
            give it, I find it to be without any limitations or attributes, perfectly simple, indivisible, obvious, and
            accessible right here at this very moment.
        </p>
        <p>It is me, but not mine. It belongs just as much to that annoying person as to me. It is the inside story of
            what we both really are. As this, at this level, I am him and he is me. I can, silently, but with total
            sincerity, say to him: ‘Here, I am you. To hurt you is to hurt myself.’
        </p>
        <p>Of course it isn’t necessary that he should see the situation that way, and I’m unlikely to
            burden him with an account of what I’m up to. And even if both of us are consciously enjoying this
            basic unity, it doesn’t follow that we shall at once, or ever, cease to give each other a pain in the
            (no) neck from time to time. But our behaviour towards each other will at least be spontaneous, basically
            loving, and in the long run mutually helpful. For this seeing What or Who we really are isn’t love in
            the ordinary sense. It goes deeper than that. It is love’s basis. It is that conscious identity at the
            deepest level, which liberates us to enjoy our immense differences at every other level.
        </p>
        <p>A final word about the practice of this fifth way. It sounds complicated: in fact, it is simplicity itself.
            But it isn’t easy. The lifelong habit of taking everybody’s word for what it’s like right
            here, except the word of the one who is right here—myself—isn’t quickly outgrown. Society’s
            basic confidence trick (that I am here what I look like to you there, a solid thing, neck and all) isn’t
            seen through once and for all. Only I am in a position to say how it is here, but the world has intimidated
            me, and it takes time to get back my courage to look for myself at myself, and then live by what I find.
        </p>
        <p>It helps to have problems. If I’m having trouble relating to people, I have a powerful motive for
            seeing Who is having this trouble. For I find that all my problems—including that of spontaneity—boil
            down to the problem of my identity. Who am I? It is extremely easy to look and see for myself what the
            answer is: namely, that I am, at 1st person, just Capacity. 1 It is less easy to go on looking till the
            social confidence trick—which makes me out to be 3rd-person only—ceases to take me in. But
            neither is it as hard as it is often advertised to be.
        </p>

        <p>1 For instance, I have only to point here (to the place where I imagined that I experienced a neck) to see
            that my finger is pointing in to empty space. Or I have only to look down at my trunk to see that it stops
            well short of my neck, and carries, Atlas-like, the world.
