        <h1>Four Stages Of Life</h1>

        <p class="author">Richard Lang</p>

        <p>Throughout our lives we’re always two-sided. We always have both a public and a private identity. On
            the one hand we are individuals in the eyes of others, on the other hand we are capacity for the world.
            However, we are not always aware of our two-sided nature. There are potentially four main stages in our
            lives, and as we move through these stages our attention oscillates between our public and our private
            selves. Sometimes our focus is on one side, sometimes on the other. The four main stages are the baby, the
            child, the adult and the seer.
        </p>

        <h2>1. The Baby</h2>

        <p class="titled">In the first stage we were unaware of our appearance, unaware of our public identity. We hadn’t
            yet learned to see ourselves through the eyes of others. Conscious only of our own point of view, our
            private reality, we were faceless, at large, space for the world, without putting it in these or in any
            terms.

        <h2>2. The Child</h2>

        <p class="titled">In the second stage of the child we were becoming aware of our public identity. Seeing
            ourselves more and more through the eyes of others, we began learning to take responsibility for ourselves
            as individuals. In the process we began overlooking our private reality. But our attention was inconsistent.
            Often we would forget about our public identity, completely losing ourselves in whatever we were doing. But
            as we grew older, these periods of unselfconscious openness and freedom came less often and went more
            quickly.
        </p>

        <h2>3. The Adult</h2>

        <p class="titled">In the third stage of the adult we identify profoundly with our public identity. Seeing
            ourselves as others see us, we’re in no doubt at all that we are what we look like. In this stage we
            deny the reality of who we really are. It would seem that the price of genuinely becoming a person is the
            loss of our private self. We may not lose it for long, but lose it we must. Many benefits flow from becoming
            an individual, but though we may not know it, we are now cut off from our centre and source. It’s not
            surprising if we find ourselves feeling that something isn’t quite right, that we are missing
            something important.
        </p>

        <h2>4. The Seer</h2>

        <p class="titled">Fortunately this need not be the end of our journey. We can go on to the fourth stage of the
            seer where we discover the reality of our private self and begin drawing on its immense healing power.
            Seeing who we really are at centre we now begin living a truly balanced, two-sided life – private as
            well as public, public as well as private.
        </p>

        <img src="../../_common/images/articles/four-stages-2.jpg" />

        <p>One of the good things about losing touch with our private self as we grow up is that when we return to it we
            see it with fresh eyes. It seems that we have to leave Home before we can really appreciate how wonderful
            Home is. And because our individuality doesn’t disappear when we see who we really are, we can now
            celebrate our one consciousness with many voices.
        </p>

        <h2>The Awakening of Humanity</h2>

        <p class="titled">These stages are a map for each of us individually. They are also, in general terms, a map for
            our species. In the distant past we were not very self-conscious: not having yet developed the art of seeing
            ourselves from outside, we didn’t have a strong idea of being separate from the rest of the world.
            More recently we have become highly conscious of our appearance, of being human and therefore separate from
            other species and the planet. (Identifying with the objective view of ourselves, we dismiss our original
            subjective view as ‘primitive’.) However, this narrow, exclusive, one-sided view of ourselves is
            now giving way to a combination of the objective and the subjective – a two-sided view. As well as
            being aware of what we look like at a certain range – our human identity – a growing number of
            us are also seeing who we really are, our central non-identity that, infinitely wide and deep, includes all
            beings, all things. This development suggests that as a species we are now moving into the next stage of
            consciousness. If you are seeing your true Self, you are evidence of this evolutionary change. Hopefully
            enough of us will see who we really are quickly enough to transform the way we as a species see ourselves
            – before our narrow, one-sided view causes us, and the rest of life, irreparable harm. Surely we can
            no longer go on with only a few of us enjoying Enlightenment. We need it to be the norm. The survival of
            civilisation and life as we know it may well depend on, if not the majority of us, at least an influential
            minority, awakening to and acting from our central, all-inclusive Self.
        </p>
        <p>However, important as numbers are, it’s not really a numbers game. When just one of us looks within and
            sees the one indivisible Self that we all are, then she (or he) is seeing as and for all of us –
            though we may not know it, she knows it for us. We are all within the One that she is. In this sense, when
            any one of us awakens to our true Self, then that one – that One – gathers the rest of us up in
            his or her awakening – in the One’s awakening to itself.
        </p>
        <p>Seeing now the Light within yourself, you are seeing as and for us all. You are gathering us all up in the
            Light. Thank you!
