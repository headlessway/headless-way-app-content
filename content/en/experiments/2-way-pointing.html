        <h1>Two-Way Pointing</h1>
        <p>Point with one index finger out at the world and with your other index finger in at your no-face.</p>
        <img src="../../_common/images/experiments/2-way-pointing.jpg" />
        <p>The finger pointing outwards points at a scene full of countless shapes and colours. It’s a complicated
            picture. The more you look at it, the more there is to see. And most of it is hidden – obscured by other
            things in one way or another.
        </p>
        <p>The view in is different. Here the space is not hidden at all. You see all of it, all at once. There I see
            only part of the room, but here I see all of the space. There is nothing more to view here, nothing
            concealed. Nor is this Being that I am here – and that you are here (I suggest) – distant. It’s right here.
        </p>
        <p>What could be simpler than seeing this – and being this? It is uncomplicated, transparent, open to
            inspection, nearer than near, given in its entirety…
        </p>
        <p>Two-way attention reveals that we cannot see this boundless space without seeing something in it, cannot hear
            this silence without hearing sounds in it, cannot attend to this awake nothingness without finding something
            emerging miraculously from it. This aware emptiness is never just empty – it is always filled with
            something. What a wonder!
