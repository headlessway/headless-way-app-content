        <h1>Online Video Meetings</h1>
        <p>We have several online video meetings each week.</p>
        <p>This is a growing community of friends who find the headless way valuable and who want to hang out together, share responses to being headless, and develop friendships based on Seeing.</p>
        <p>These meetings are free and drop-in.</p>
        <p>If you have done some experiments, find the Headless Way of value, and would like to join us, please contact <a href="mailto:headexchange@gn.apc.org">Richard</a>. He will send you more information.</p>
        <p>If you want to view video recordings of meetings (normal meetings are not recorded), then visit our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/headexchange">YouTube channel</a> and scroll down to Online Meetings.</p>
