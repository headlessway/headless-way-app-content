        <h1>The Single Eye</h1>
        <p>How many eyes are you looking out of? Other people see your two eyes, and you see two in the mirror, but how
            many do you see from your point of view? Perhaps you have been overlooking something both obvious and
            wonderful.
        </p>
        <p>I am looking out of one eye. In fact it’s not an eye – it’s an undivided, edgeless space, a single, frameless
            Window.
        </p>

        <p>To bring attention to your single Eye, hold your hands in front of you as if they are a pair of glasses you
            are going to put on. You see two holes.
        </p>
        <img src="images/single-eye-2.jpg" />
        <p>Bring them closer, as if you are putting them on like glasses.</p>
        <img src="images/single-eye-3.jpg" />
        <p>Bring them right up to you,</p>
        <img src="images/single-eye-4.jpg" />
        <p>and put them on.</p>
        <p>What has happened to the dividing line between the two holes? Hasn’t it disappeared, leaving one undivided
            space that you are looking out of?
        </p>
        <p>Observe the edge of your field of vision. Is there a clear line around it, a definite edge? I find the world
            fades out gradually. Into what?
        </p>
        <img src="images/single-eye-5.jpg" />
        <p>Move your hand to the edge of the field of vision and watch it vanish into nothing!</p>
        <img src="images/single-eye-6.jpg" />
        <p>How wide is this Eye of yours? Wider than the world?</p>
        <img src="images/single-eye-7.jpg" />
        <p>Here is the ‘edge of the world’. What is beyond it? A space without end?</p>
        <p>You are this awake space – the space in which the world appears. All things are within you.</p>
        <p>You can see your single Eye anywhere, anytime. Discover how relaxing it is – being this clear, edgeless
            Window.
