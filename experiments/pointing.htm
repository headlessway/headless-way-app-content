        <h1>Pointing Experiment</h1>
        <!-- BODY -->
        <p>A step-by-step way of guiding your attention to the formless centre of yourself&hellip;</p>
        <img alt="" src="images/pointing-1.jpg" />
        <p>Point at something in front of you. You see a thing there. Notice its form and colour.</p>
        <img alt="" src="images/pointing-2.jpg" />
        <p>Point at your shoe. Notice its form and colour. Another thing.</p>
        <img alt="" src="images/pointing-3.jpg" />
        <p>Point at your knee &ndash; another thing.</p>
        <img alt="" src="images/pointing-4.jpg" />
        <p>Point at your torso &ndash; yet another thing.</p>
        <img alt="" src="images/pointing-5.jpg" />
        <p>Now point at where others see your face &ndash; the place you are looking out of. What do you see at zero distance? Do you see your face? Do you see anything at all?</p>
        <p>I see no face here. Instead I see space, emptiness&hellip; This space is now filled with my finger, plus the rest of the room, sounds, sensations, thoughts&hellip; From my point of view I am not a limited thing &ndash; I am boundless capacity for the world.</p>
        <p>What do you find? Are you also capacity for the world?</p>
