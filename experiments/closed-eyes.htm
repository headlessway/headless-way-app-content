        <h1>Closed Eyes Experiment</h1>
        <!-- BODY -->
        <p>Explore who and what you are with eyes closed. Practically speaking, probably the best way to do this is to read a question, then close your eyes and investigate your experience. Then open your eyes, read another question, and so on. Take it slowly. Or get a friend to read the text to you whilst you have your eyes closed.</p>
        <p>With EYES CLOSED consider the following:</p>
        <p>Going by present experience, not by memory or imagination –</p>
        <p>Can you say how big you are?</p>
        <p>Can you say what shape you are?</p>
        <p>Can you find a boundary that divides you from the rest of the world?</p>
        <p>Attend to the sensation of your right foot. Does it have a shape? Does it have a size? Attend to all your body sensations. Does the whole field of sensation have a shape or a size? Are you inside it or is it inside you – inside boundless awareness?</p>
        <p>Listen to sounds. Is the sound of your breathing more inside you than other sounds? Are not all sounds given here in awareness, at no distance? Is there a dividing line between inside and outside?</p>
        <p>Attend to thoughts and feelings. Where are they? Are they inside a thing called ‘you’? Are thoughts and feelings more inside you than the sound of birdsong, or traffic, or whatever you can hear? Or do thoughts and feelings come and go in edgeless awareness, just like everything else?</p>
        <p>Isn’t it true, whether you have your eyes closed or open, that you have no boundaries, that everything is within you?</p>
        <p>Open your eyes and see the world re-appear in your one Eye.</p>
