        <h1>Stress to No Stress</h1>
        <!-- BODY -->
        <img alt="" src="images/stress-1.jpg" />
        <p>Look at your hand. You are seeing it from emptiness. This is two-way looking &ndash; thing there seen from no-thing here, colour there seen in clearness here, shape there presented to the absence of shape here.</p>
        <img alt="" src="images/stress-2.jpg" />
        <p>Now tense your hand into a fist. You feel stress there, arising in the absence of stress here. Now relax your hand. The tension melts away &ndash; a relaxed feeling taking its place in the unchanging absence of feeling here.</p>
        <p>There in your body, in your mind, in your world, there may at times be lots of stress. Always there will be some &ndash; life is like that. But here at centre you are always free of stress. If you are aware that you operate into this stressful world from this stress-free place, it&rsquo;s likely you will feel less stressed. It is deeply relaxing to be conscious of this totally still and peaceful place at one&rsquo;s centre.</p>
        <p>Draw on this resource whenever you find yourself in a stressful situation. Stay aware of the stress-free space here whilst responding to whatever stress you experience there.</p>
        <p>This stress-free emptiness isn&rsquo;t a special state of mind achieved or maintained by a technique &ndash; it is the stress-free emptiness in which all states of mind come and go. This full emptiness is always available, whatever your mood, whatever your situation.</p>
        <p>Your body and mind get stressed but your true Self is always at ease.</p>
