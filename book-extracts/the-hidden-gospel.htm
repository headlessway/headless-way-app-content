        <strong>
        HOW TO SEE GOD </strong><br />
        <br />
        Jesus said:&nbsp;
        <div><br />
        Why do you call me good? There is none good but one: that is God.&nbsp;</div>
        <div><br />
        The Father is in me.&nbsp;</div>
        <div><br />
        When you see the one who was not born of woman... he is your Father.</div>
        <div>&nbsp; <br />
        Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</div>
        <div>&nbsp; <br />
        The time is coming when... I shall plainly show you the Father. <br />
        <br />
        Set-up: Get into pairs. Time: 8 mins. Gear: None.&nbsp;</div>
        <div>
        <br />
        We think that it is easy to see a man, but hard to see God; easy to see a hand, a flower, a chair, but hard to see its origin. Let's test this.</div>
        <div>&nbsp; <br />
        Examine very carefully your neighbour's face, at a distance of about 10 inches.</div>
        <div>&nbsp; <br />
        Notice how, at this very moment, only a tiny area&mdash;a wrinkle, a pore, a hair or two &mdash;stands out sharp and clear, and how hazy it becomes when you shift to another.&nbsp;</div>
        <div><br />
        Go on scanning that scene.&nbsp;</div>
        <div><br />
        How many days, months, years, would it take to attend to every detail in turn, so that at last you could say you had clearly seen that face&mdash;had taken in the lot?&nbsp;</div>
        <div><br />
        Would it obligingly stay the same, awaiting the end of your survey?&nbsp;</div>
        <div><br />
        Could you hope to keep pace with its changing?&nbsp;</div>
        <div><br />
        Could you ever see it with complete objectivity, as all others might do?&nbsp;</div>
        <div><br />
        Aren't your ever-changing viewpoint, the pattern of your scanning, indeed all your impressions, at least as much to do with you as with him?&nbsp;</div>
        <div><br />
        In short, can you ever do more than glimpse your neighbour?&nbsp;</div>
        <div><br />
        Now, still looking at his face, compare it with yours&mdash;with your no-face, the kingdom within, 'the one who was not born of woman'.&nbsp;</div>
        <div><br />
        Seeing <em>this</em>, don&rsquo;t you see it all-at-once, free of time, perfectly (with or without your glasses), as it always was and will be,  exactly as Jesus saw it 2000 years ago,&nbsp;</div>
        <div><br />
        exactly as every one of its observers&mdash;past, present, future&mdash;sees it?&nbsp;</div>
        <div><br />
        What is here to uncover, to differ about, to get to know better?&nbsp;</div>
        <div><br />
        To see this at all is to see it to perfection.&nbsp;</div>
        <div><br />
        Only God can be truly seen because only God is truly simple.&nbsp;</div>
        <div><br />
        And who could it be that is now seeing God here, but himself?&nbsp;</div>
        <div><br />
        <em>
        Repeat the texts:&nbsp;</em></div>
        <div><br />
        Jesus said:&nbsp;</div>
        <div><br />
        </div>
        <div>Why do you call me good? There is none good but one: that is God. The Father is in me.&nbsp;</div>
        <div><br />
        When you see the one who was not born of woman... he is your Father.&nbsp;</div>
        <div><br />
        Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.&nbsp;</div>
        <div><br />
        The time is coming when... I shall plainly show you the Father.</div>

As Harding used to say, "Test the scriptures by your experience, not your experience by the scriptures.")</div>
