        <h2>by Colin Oliver</h2>
        <strong>Bees&nbsp;</strong>
        <div><strong><br />
        </strong>To the orchard<br />
        we take the new hive<br />
        and put on our veiled hats. <br />
        <br />
        The swarm hangs<br />
        among the apple blossom. <br />
        Down they drop <br />
        <br />
        with one shake<br />
        of the branch &ndash;<br />
        half a bucket of bees! <br />
        <br />
        Poured into the hive <br />
        they quieten<br />
        to the drip of syrup. <br />
        <br />
        Watching,<br />
        I&rsquo;m a veiled hat <br />
        with nobody inside. <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        Wolf&nbsp;</strong></div>
        <div><br />
        World I am you;<br />
        I cannot be kept at bay. <br />
        A wolf, I take all<br />
        in one bite. <br />
        <br />
        My features have become <br />
        nothing but mouth,<br />
        a mouth nothing but air. <br />
        <br />
        Here on the plain<br />
        of openness<br />
        I am ever new to myself. <br />
        <br />
        And the world before me <br />
        is like a forest<br />
        on which suddenly<br />
        snow has fallen.</div>

        <div>(A collection of poems. "<span style="background-color: #fffcf6; font-size: 16px;">The poems are arranged in roughly chronological order. Many early ones are expressive of seeing into that transparent inner nature which I believe we all share but so often overlook. Later poems widen the scope but are suffused, I think, with the same essential awareness. I have carried some home from the fields and hedgerows intent on keeping observations spare and scrupulous. Occasionally the subject of renewal in different guises has pressed itself upon me, like a refrain. Here are also bitter-sweet memories involving experiences and people called into the present and held with a tenderness. It is my hope that the reader will discover poems in this book which will be like stepping stones to a place of stillness." Colin Oliver.)</span></div>
