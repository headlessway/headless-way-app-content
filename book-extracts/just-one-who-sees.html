        <h1>From 'Just One Who Sees'</h1>

        <p class="author">by Douglas Harding</p>

        <h2>Lines Written On My 97th Birthday</h2>

        <p>
            Do not go ungrateful<br />
            into your everlasting bliss<br />
            but let your gratitude surface<br />
            with your mounting amazement<br />
            that anything at all exists<br />
            and that only the first person<br />
            singular present tense<br />
            is really and truly awake<br />
            and is none other than the Love<br />
            that makes the world go round<br />
            and leaves no-one whatever out<br />
        </p>


        <h2>Just One Who Sees</h2>

        <p>
            To walk around in the wide world<br />
            looking out at its<br />
            everchanging shapes and colours<br />
            and simultaneously looking in at its<br />
            neverchanging clarity<br />
            right finger pointing outwards<br />
            left finger pointing inwards<br />
            is to be the One Seer in all beings<br />
            the kingdom the power and the glory<br />
            the unfathomable mystery<br />
            the early morning freshness of the world<br />
        </p>

        <p>Here are Douglas Harding’s poems: engaging, passionate, quirky and original. They are selected from
            those he wrote in his last months, a late flowering of his remarkable creativity.
        </p>
        <p>All his life Douglas had imbibed poetry, from the King James Bible to Hopkins, Yeats and Frost. Lines
            committed to memory were quoted enthusiastically and incisively in conversation.
        </p>
        <p>Poems touched him deeply and he owned them. Finally, in those last months, he fell upon a form – free,
            unpunctuated, pithy – into which he could pour his essential heartfelt concerns in a fresh and playful
            way. He loved the process: mulling over an idea (“marinating” was his word) and finding the
            exact expression. And then, with a captivating intensity, he would share his work with visiting friends.
        </p>

        <p>Happily, now that this selection is available, the circle of those appreciating Douglas’ poetry will widen.</p>
