        <h1>From 'Incredible Countries'</h1>

        <p class="author">by Colin Oliver</p>

        <h2>Bees</h2>

        <p>To the orchard<br />
            we take the new hive<br />
            and put on our veiled hats. <br />
            <br />
            The swarm hangs<br />
            among the apple blossom. <br />
            Down they drop <br />
            <br />
            with one shake<br />
            of the branch –<br />
            half a bucket of bees! <br />
            <br />
            Poured into the hive <br />
            they quieten<br />
            to the drip of syrup. <br />
            <br />
            Watching,<br />
            I’m a veiled hat <br />
            with nobody inside.
        </p>

        <h2>Wolf</h2>
        <p>
            World I am you;<br />
            I cannot be kept at bay. <br />
            A wolf, I take all<br />
            in one bite. <br />
            <br />
            My features have become <br />
            nothing but mouth,<br />
            a mouth nothing but air. <br />
            <br />
            Here on the plain<br />
            of openness<br />
            I am ever new to myself. <br />
            <br />
            And the world before me <br />
            is like a forest<br />
            on which suddenly<br />
            snow has fallen.

        <p class="remarks">(A collection of poems. "The poems are arranged in roughly chronological order. Many early ones are
            expressive of seeing into that transparent inner nature which I believe we all share but so often overlook.
            Later poems widen the scope but are suffused, I think, with the same essential awareness. I have carried
            some home from the fields and hedgerows intent on keeping observations spare and scrupulous. Occasionally
            the subject of renewal in different guises has pressed itself upon me, like a refrain. Here are also
            bitter-sweet memories involving experiences and people called into the present and held with a tenderness.
            It is my hope that the reader will discover poems in this book which will be like stepping stones to a place
            of stillness." Colin Oliver.)
