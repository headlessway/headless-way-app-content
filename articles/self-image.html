        <h1>Self-image</h1>

        <p class="author">Richard Lang</p>

        <p>Other people see your face, your appearance, but you don’t – except indirectly. You depend on
            reflections from others, from your environment, from mirrors and cameras to know who you are in the world.
            This is human self-consciousness: being aware of your appearance, of you-as-you-are-for-others.
        </p>

        <p>These images of yourself (changing as you grow older) occur to you as 'capacity', to
            you-as-you-are-for-yourself. You are faceless, yet at the same time you have in mind (you are capacity for)
            an image of your face – or your body, your family, religion, nation, race… Your self-image at
            this level is human.
        </p>

        <p>If you imagine the face of the planet you are still entertaining a self-image, but because this image is not
            human you may not think of it as yourself. Yet it is yourself: it is you from further away. At this range
            you are planetary.
        </p>
        <p>Entertaining any image of how you look, whether it’s human, planetary, solar, galactic…
            cellular, molecular, atomic… is being self-conscious.
        </p>
        <p>Who thinks of these images? Who is self-conscious at all these different levels? You know yourself as a
            person, a planet, a star, a molecule… Who is the ‘you’, the reality behind your many
            appearances? Point at the ‘you’ and see.
