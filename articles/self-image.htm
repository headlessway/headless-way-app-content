        <h1>Self-image</h1>
        <!-- BODY -->

        <p>Other people see your face, your appearance, but you don&rsquo;t &ndash; except indirectly. You depend on reflections from others, from your environment, from mirrors and cameras to know who you are in the world. This is human self-consciousness: being aware of your appearance, of you-as-you-are-for-others.</p>
        <img alt="" src="images/self-image-1.jpg" />
        <p>These images of yourself (changing as you grow older) occur to you as 'capacity', to you-as-you-are-for-yourself. You are faceless, yet at the same time you have in mind (you are capacity for) an image of your face &ndash; or your body, your family, religion, nation, race&hellip; Your self-image at this level is human.</p>
        <img alt="" src="images/self-image-2.jpg" />
        <p>If you imagine the face of the planet you are still entertaining a self-image, but because this image is not human you may not think of it as yourself. Yet it is yourself: it is you from further away. At this range you are planetary.</p>
        <p>Entertaining any image of how you look, whether it&rsquo;s human, planetary, solar, galactic&hellip; cellular, molecular, atomic&hellip; is being self-conscious.</p>
        <p>Who thinks of these images? Who is self-conscious at all these different levels? You know yourself as a person, a planet, a star, a molecule&hellip; Who is the &lsquo;you&rsquo;, the reality behind your many appearances? Point at the &lsquo;you&rsquo; and see.</p>
