        <h1>The Results Of Seeing</h1>

        <p class="author">Douglas Harding</p>

        <p>In so far as one sees clearly and steadily into one's Void Nature, into how it is right here and now, what
            happens is this:-
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>One's senses waken.</strong> Colours, textures, sounds, tastes, smells &ndash; all sensations are
            apt to take on a new brilliance, poignancy, novelty, in the sharpest contrast to their plain Background
            here.
            For instance, it is common (even when one has just begun to see) to find colours &ndash; such as the traffic
            lights and pavements and the sides of taxis &ndash; unbelievably glowing and beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>One's heart goes out to the world.</strong> The more I take care of the Coolness here the more the
            warmth takes care of itself there. It's not that I feel myself to be more loving (my love goes out to you
            and cannot be retained here) but that you are seen to be more lovable. My feelings, adhering now to their
            objects instead of their Subject (Who finds nothing here to attach them to) become real and spontaneous
            feelings and no longer put-on or worked-up, sentimental ones. Ceasing to cultivate and wallow in my own
            states &ndash; an anxious, self-defeating, absurd habit &ndash; I'm free at last to enjoy people and the
            world just as they come, from this their Empty Source. In other words, my mind, with all its thoughts and
            feelings, is centrifugal. Ceasing to be a small, local, private, personal possession abstracted from the
            universe there and shut up in a brain-box here (as if it could be!) my mind is at large, is the same old
            world, yet utterly different. It is replete with a mind and meaning I no longer abstract from it. It is all
            there, because I claim none of it for myself. It is sane. It makes sense. It is loved.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>One's mind awakens.</strong> Ideas, inspiration, guidance from moment to moment, flow without
            obstruction from their Source, which is experienced here as Itself mindless. Paradoxically, to be really
            creative, to be really intelligent about things there, one must be a conscious numb-skull here,
            empty-headed, clueless, blank.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>One's day-to-day problems are sorted out.</strong> These range from finding a parking place to
            deciding where to live, from how to get rid of mice to how to get on with one's mother-in-law. Their answer
            is to see Who has them. Then they &ndash; the problems &ndash; are removed rather than abolished, placed
            rather than solved; but this placing is, in effect, their solution. Here, one is shot of all problems.
            Minding one's own Business here, one notes with interest events there, and what one is led to do about them.
            The result may be surprising, mysterious, even shocking or absurd, but in the long run it shows a wisdom, an
            uncanny prescience, far beyond mere human computation. When at last, baffled and exhausted, one has the good
            sense to hand over from one's human computer (which takes account of only a fraction of the relevant data),
            to one's Universal Computer, to the Void Itself (which takes account of all the data), the answers that come
            out are the right ones. Not man, but the One who lives in man, knows best. So he finds when he abandons his
            imagined self to his true Self. The radical answer to every problem is never to lose sight of this Self in
            any circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Whatever the problem there, its solution lies here, at 180&deg; to it:</strong> the one-way, direct
            approach is never good enough. Perseus' problem was Medusa &ndash; to view her directly was to be made into
            stone, so he turned round and viewed her indirectly, mirrored in the shield given to him by the Goddess of
            Wisdom, and was safe. Similarly the world and its faces cease to petrify me &ndash; making me into a mere
            3rd person, a face among faces and a thing among things &ndash; once I turn to What mirrors the world here
            so clearly. Only the 1st person, the No-thing, can cope with 2nd and 3rd persons, with things.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>One's unconscious is taken care of.</strong> Only the No-mind can cope with the mind &ndash;
            conscious and unconscious. Another ancient myth puts the whole matter beautifully. An Eastern King sent his
            son down to Egypt to find the Pearl of Self-knowledge. Arrived there, he ate the food and wore the clothes
            of the Egyptians till he became drugged and forgot Who he was and why he was in Egypt. His Father, hearing
            of this, sent a bird-messenger to remind him, and the Prince set out to find the Pearl. Eventually he
            learned that it lay at the bottom of a lake, guarded by a terrible serpent. Braving the monster, he dived
            in, snatched the Pearl, and returned with it to his Father's house, on the way there donning his blue robe
            &ndash; the starry firmament.
        </p>
        <p>Note that the Prince neither ignores nor takes on the serpent (his own unconscious, demonic, animal nature)
            but by-passes it. If one fights the serpent (as in direct moral discipline) he's always about to give in but
            never actually does so; and if one makes friends and parleys with the serpent (as in the many varieties of
            psychological exploration and analysis) he's delighted to keep up the dialogue indefinitely &ndash; and
            meantime to sit snugly on the Pearl. But if, like our hero, one creeps by the serpent when he's least alert
            and seizes the Pearl, one is then armed with the perfect dragon-taming charm. The sword of discipline only
            scratched and stimulated him, friendly overtures only encouraged him to keep one talking for life, but the
            talisman of Self-knowledge he respects. It doesn't allow one to ignore him (quite the contrary) nor is he
            reduced overnight to a pussy-cat (indeed he can put up a show of angry violence at the loss of his Jewel)
            but he knows his Master &ndash; and how to serve Him.
        </p>
        <p>Take any psychological trouble large or small &ndash; for example, one's irritability, one's meanness, one's
            fear of spiders and of heights, one's anxiety that one isn't loving enough. The cure of the trouble isn't to
            go into it out of Oneself, not to retreat from it into Oneself, but to face it from Oneself &ndash; to look
            into it from Here, consciously to view it from this trouble-free Home whose windows open wide and clear onto
            the troubled scene. As always, the solution is two-way looking, seeing simultaneously what one's looking at
            and What one's looking out of &ndash; face to No-face, thing to No-thing, problem to No-problem. This
            therapy works because it fits the facts, for in truth one can never leave Home, nor shut out the view from
            Home, nor separate them.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>One ceases playing games.</strong> The basic move in all the tragi-comic games one plays is
            pretending to leave Home, stationing oneself in imagination over there and turning in upon oneself and
            putting on a face here &ndash; putting on some particular act and its masks for the benefit of the audience.
            And the basic cure is to see oneself Home and live here facelessly, live from within outwards, live to
            express not impress. What people make of one then is their business: one's own business is one's Void
            &ndash; and the people who fill It. To strike them as a real, sincere, natural, game-free person, it is only
            necessary to attend to the Nothing here and leave all such build-up &ndash; one's development from this
            Empty Source here to its regional effects in them &ndash; to take care of itself. To be interested in one's
            self-image is to spoil it. Deliberately to project a self is to project a false self. While seeing Who one
            really is, one is game-free; while overlooking This, one is at least playing the Face Game, and probably
            some of its derivatives as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>One finds peace of mind.</strong> At the Centre is always perfection, off-Centre always
            imperfection.
            Man as man is (to say the least) lacking, and no amount of seeing Who he really is will make a human into an
            angel or the human scene into Utopia, let alone Heaven. The effects of his seeing will, if he persists,
            certainly become evident in his personality and environment, but they will vary immensely and will often
            seem to him to be very meagre indeed. One thing alone can be relied on through all circumstances, and that
            is their Core of Peace. The seer may often find himself in a tragic and sad and puzzling and troublesome
            world, but he never (so long as he's seeing) lacks peace of mind. His basic anxiety has gone. Seeing that he
            is indeed Peace Itself, he is at rest.
