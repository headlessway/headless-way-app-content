        <h1>The One That Is Many</h1>

        <p class="author">Richard Lang</p>

        <p>When I assume I am only what I look like (in the process, overlooking my no-face) then I consider all others
            to be outside me, distant, not me, other – and potentially threatening. I confront them with my face,
            my appearance, my body, nationality, age… Confrontation too often leads to conflict. It is a 'me and
            you' situation, an 'us and them' scenario.
        </p>
        <p>What difference does it make when I awaken to my no-face, when I see I am this infinite capacity? I am still
            aware of my face, still aware of being a separate individual – I know my body is separate from yours,
            I know my experiences are different from yours. But I am now also aware that all bodies are within me, all
            views are views from this one consciousness that I am looking out of. In other words, you are not simply
            'other', you are also myself. I don’t confront you face to face but include you, face to space. I am
            you.
        </p>
        <p>How seriously I take this awareness will change the way I relate to 'others', for I am seeing that 'others'
            are myself. Once you have awoken to this truth, you can keep returning to it. Find out how Seeing affects
            the way you respond to others. Enjoy the life-changing discovery that others are both ‘other’
            and ‘yourself’.
        </p>
        <p>In a crowded railway station, at the office, at home – wherever you are you can be aware that you
            include and contain everyone and everything.
