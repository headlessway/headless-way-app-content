                <p>The ups and downs of life where you find life going on, above that bottom line of yours… go on
                    regardless of whether they are resented, or just tolerated, or in the end (whether by God’s good grace,
                    or simple looking-to-see, or both) welcomed with open arms. The art of handling these inexorable
                    goings-on is the art of resting on what underlies them, the art and science of consciously being the
                    ground which supports all that commotion without itself becoming disturbed in the slightest. Here, you
                    are the bedrock of the world, where it all begins and where it all ends. Eternally one and the same, you
                    are the Unmoved Mover. Douglas Harding, Head Off Stress.
                </p>
                <p>Are we face-to-face, in symmetrical relationship, object confronting object, each shutting out the
                    other? Quite the contrary. Here where I am is no face, no speck of anything to ward you off with, to
                    resist your invasion. Whether I like it or not, I’m so wide open to you that your face is mine and I
                    have no other. Douglas Harding, Look For Yourself.
                </p>
                <p>If we really look at what it’s like where we are, surely we can see we are built for loving, we are
                    built open, we are built as capacity for the other one, the loved one - or the one who is perhaps not
                    consciously loved so much. We disappear in his or her favour, not because we are very nice or very
                    loving people really but because that is the way we are, to vanish in favour of that one there. Douglas
                    Harding. DVD: On Having No Head.
                </p>
                <p>I find in me two wills, one that belongs to the pre-mortem life of the one in my mirror, and the other
                    which belongs to the post-mortem life of the one this side of my mirror. The former is quick to say NO!
                    to a good half of what happens to me, while the latter eventually says YES! – SO BE IT! – to it all. And
                    does so with good reason: I see that right here all my resistance is dissolved and I’m burst wide open
                    to receive whatever’s in store for me. Saying Yes! to it is often excruciatingly difficult, of course,
                    but it turns out to be the recipe for the only peace worth having. And so at last the paradox holds:
                    it’s because I have no will that my will is done. Right here, total impotence and total omnipotence come
                    to the same thing. Douglas Harding, To Be And Not To Be.
                </p>
                <p>Absence is for acceptance as absence, not as the presence of a well- concealed gold-mine. The gold comes
                    out all right, but unsought, in its own good time and unpredictable shape. Douglas Harding, The Science
                    of the 1st Person.

                <p>When you start living the heroic life – that is, living from your true Nature – your peripheral and
                    human nature is bound to benefit. You cannot know in advance how or when, but you can count on Yourself
                    the superhuman hero giving yourself the human non-hero a helping hand and a leg up where necessary.
                    Douglas Harding, Head Off Stress.
                </p>
                <p>It would be difficult to overstate the practical importance of this discovery, its consequences for
                    everyday living. All alienation, all separation, the many-sided threat of hostile things and persons and
                    situations – these are no more than bad dreams. All is You. How could you fear Yourself? How could you
                    despise, resent, be bored by Yourself? How could you not love Yourself? Douglas Harding, Look For
                    Yourself.
                </p>
                <p>Again we come to the great question, Who or What am I in my own experience? Am I a thing consumed with
                    fear and anxiety and soon to perish and be forgotten, or am I the No-thing which includes things of
                    different life-spans, from galaxies to particles and people? Things come and go within my Space, which
                    is not the kind of thing that comes and goes. And therefore I am not frightened, I am not scared out of
                    my wits, if I really live from Who I am and What I am which is my No-thingness, which is absolutely
                    safe. Incomparable Safety is at your Centre, I suggest, Incomparable Safety. Because No-thing is
                    absolutely safe. The aware No-thing where you are is not the kind of thing that can be destroyed.
                    Douglas Harding. DVD: On Having No Head.
                </p>
                <p>Yet it’s no bad thing to be fearful, provided we’re driven to the one refuge from all danger and stress
                    and fear – to this incomparable Safety, to the Place or No-place we have all along been at. By pointing
                    a finger – or simply looking at What we’re looking out of at this moment, or by any other means that
                    works for us – let’s get Home to What we are. Let’s stay with and live from this absolutely safe Reality
                    instead of that accident-prone appearance in our mirror, and see what comes of it, what happens to our
                    stress. Douglas Harding, Head Off Stress.
                </p>
                <p>So it all comes back to the crucial question of my true Identity. If I insist on making an object and a
                    thing and a 3rd person of myself here, I am consumed with a thousand fears and better off dead. But if I
                    give up this unrealistic and unrewarding habit and come to Myself, I see that I have never emerged from
                    that marvellous Abyss, that before Abraham was I am, before the first galaxy and the first atom, before
                    time itself. Right here and now, in the very place all this stormy weather of time and change come from,
                    I am Home and dry. Where can I go from this Safe Haven? Douglas Harding, The Science of the 1st Person.
                </p>
                <p>What a relief to be backed by the One whose name is I AM, the name that precedes and introduces every
                    other name. What a relief to merge into and be upheld by the Unlimited. Douglas Harding, The Trial of
                    the Man who said he was God.
                </p>
                <p>This meditation is safe, not only because it can’t be bungled, not only because it avoids dependence
                    upon others on the one hand and self-pride on the other, but also because it is uncontrived. There’s
                    nothing arbitrary or fanciful about it, nothing to strain your credulity, nothing to go wrong, nothing
                    to set you apart from ordinary people, nothing special. It is safe because it is finding out how matters
                    stand, not trying to manipulate them. What could be less dangerous than ceasing to deceive yourself
                    about your Self, or more dangerous than not doing so? Douglas Harding, quoted in Seeing Who You Really
                    Are by Richard Lang.
                </p>
                <p>The spirituality that denies the universally accepted findings of modern science at all levels, or
                    refuses to face up to them and cheerfully take them on board, is a pathetic and moribund travesty of
                    spirituality. And conversely, the spirituality that perceives in these findings a rich and precious and
                    indeed divine revelation of our time and for our time and just what's needed to treat our sorry
                    condition, is alive and kicking. Douglas Harding.
                </p>
                <p>For thousands of years the wise have been siding with God and taking this way Home; and recommending,
                    with all the eloquence at their command, this royal road from human bondage back to divine freedom. Now,
                    at last, instead of being told about it by experts, we are being shown it. We are invited to see our own
                    way through to God's own country. The Clear Country we're coming from and returning to. Douglas Harding,
                    The Trial of the Man who said he was God.
                </p>
                <p>What I find difficult and unacceptable really, is the wishy-washy reliance on words, on concepts, of so
                    much alleged spirituality. True spirituality is real, down to earth, concrete - it’s coming home from
                    your appearance to your reality. As the Buddha said, you won’t by going reach that place where there is
                    the end of suffering. You’ll get it by coming. We are so good at looking that way, and lousy at looking
                    this way. DVD: Interview with Douglas Harding.
                </p>
                <p>Oddly enough, it’s the man who attends only to the outer scene, ignoring what lies at its Centre, who is
                    more or less blind to that scene. For the world is a curious phenomenon that, like a faint star, can be
                    clearly observed only when it isn’t directly looked at. The world will hide its true face from us until
                    we look in the opposite direction, catching sight of it in the mirror of the Self. Douglas Harding, Look
                    For Yourself.
                </p>
                <p>When two-way looking is persisted in, the external world is much more truly and vividly seen than when
                    it is viewed by itself and as if it were the whole story, as if it were unobserved. It must be added,
                    nevertheless, that even this enlightened way of looking at the world doesn’t begin to perfect one’s
                    knowledge of the world, whose very nature is that it can only be inspected piecemeal and never
                    comprehensively. Only its Source is given all-at-once and can be viewed unselectively, with complete
                    objectivity. Douglas Harding, The Science of the 1st Person.
                </p>
                <p>The ‘as is’ world, the world as given before I start mucking about with it, for the purpose of
                    controlling it, for the purpose of getting power over others, and so forth, the world as given to me
                    when I am simple enough to dare to look at what is presented, I say, in my experience, that world is
                    woven of blessings. It is a world full of blessing. It is a world built to a fabulously beautiful
                    design. Douglas Harding. DVD: Melbourne Lecture.
                </p>
                <p>Besides the countless particular miracles that we comprise, there is that supreme irregularity – the
                    fact that anything exists at all. Most unnaturally, there is not just Nothing. How adroit of It to
                    happen! How deserving of our congratulations It is, for having arranged its quite impossible existence!
                    After that, what are a few billion universes more or less? What impossibilities may not It or He have up
                    His sleeve? And what may I not be in Him? Douglas Harding, The Hierarchy of Heaven and Earth.

                <p>Ultimately sex doesn't come into its own till it is revealed as an aspect of the One's own joy in
                    discovering and reuniting with Itself, disguised as the not-self or other - as one very special other.
                    Douglas Harding, quoted in Seeing Who You Really Are by Richard Lang.
                </p>
                <p>I’m not saying, mind you, that a life consciously lived from its true Centre will be safe or painless,
                    easy or consistently joyful. Real adventure is made of sterner stuff. Those great arms embrace the
                    suffering of the world no less than its splendour and its thrill. Those hands know the torment of
                    crucifixion. Only so can the terrible pain of the world be overcome. The real joy, the joy that casts no
                    shadow and knows no variation, has come through the fire. Douglas Harding, To Be And Not To Be.
                </p>
                <p>In truth, only Nothing has room for Everything. Only a Nothing that’s awake to its nothingness is awake
                    to its Allness. So long as any part of me remains unsurrendered I shall never be Myself. Douglas
                    Harding, Look For Yourself.
                </p>
                <p>You see Who you are and you see that there is no place left for the mind to store things, no hooks for
                    grappling thoughts and feelings to the Centre. They are centrifugal, they belong to the world. Your
                    world becomes a living world again, it comes to life. Douglas Harding. Interviewed by Richard Lang.
                </p>
                <p>My mirror confirms this wide-openness right here where I am. The very thing which long ago put a face on
                    me now relieves me of it. Now I look in the glass to see what I’m not like! Douglas Harding, quoted in
                    Seeing Who You Really Are by Richard Lang.
                </p>
                <p>The more steadily I gaze at the One that’s nearest and clearest, the more it turns out to be the
                    dearest, more me than myself, the Resource that never really lets me down. The Wide Awake One that –
                    though homely and obvious and transparent through and through – fills me with worship and wonder at the
                    mystery of its self-origination. Who shall set limits to the bright blessings that can arise from our
                    growing willingness to trust what we see, instead of what we’re told to see? Douglas Harding, Look For

                </p>
                <p>Truly I forget in what my wealth and true grandeur lie, and how inexhaustible they are, and how my title
                    to them is my absolute poverty. Plunging head-first into the sea of nothingness, I find there untold
                    treasure. Douglas Harding, The Hierarchy of Heaven and Earth.
                </p>
                <p>I find that it is when my attention is centred primarily upon the One who is attending here, and only
                    incidentally upon the world that confronts me, that the world is made marvellous in me. Then the great
                    surprise, the most astounding fact of all, isn't what the Cosmos is but that it is; not the infinitely
                    varied products there but their simple Origin here. Nevertheless when they are seen as proceeding from
                    This they take on its wonder, and nothing is ordinary any more. Douglas Harding, The Science of the 1st

                <p>Is there a dividing line between your thoughts and the world? Isn't your mind at large?</p>
                <p>Many voices, yet only one speaker, one listener.</p>
                <p>See what is arising in this space now! Flowing from this mysterious nothingness.</p>
                <p>You are not in the world, the world is in you. Freedom!</p>
                <p>No boundaries! All is within you. All is you.</p>
                <p>Point your finger at the place you are looking out of and look! How simple and direct is that!</p>
                <p>Is there a dividing line between your body sensations and the world?</p>
                <p>This moment, all of it, is flowing from the Source - from who you really are.</p>
                <p>Problem there - the source of the problem here, and the source of the solution.</p>
                <p>Next time you drink or eat, see where the food or drink go!</p>
                <p>No distance! All is within you.</p>
                <p>This spaciousness is always available - here and now. Isn't it?</p>
                <p>Here we are one, forever.</p>
                <p>You are busted wide-open for others - built for loving.</p>

                <p>Some have never heard of the Self, some have heard and cannot find Him. He who finds Him is a world's
                    wonder; he who explains Him is a world's wonder; he who inherits Him from his Master is a world's

                <p>Knowing that thy Self is the Self of all beings and that all beings abide in the Self, released from

                <p>The Atman is that by which the universe is pervaded, but which nothing pervades; which causes all things

                <p>Being admonished to return to myself, I entered into the secret chamber of my soul. And I beheld with

                <p>Our being here is our eternal being. Many people imagine here to have creaturely being, and divine being

                <p>Where time has never entered and no form was ever seen, at the centre, the summit of the soul, their God

                </p>
                <p>To know the always-so is to be illuminated; not to know it, means to go blindly to disaster. He who
                    knows the always-so has room in him for everything; he who has room in him for everything is without
                    prejudice. Lao-tzu

                <p>Penetrate into the Centre of Nothingness. Creep as far as ever you can into the truth of your
                    Nothingness, and then nothing will disquiet you. By this gate you must enter into the happy land of the
                    living, where you will find the greatest good, the breadth of love, the beauty of justice, the straight
                    line of equity and righteousness, and, in sum, every jot and tittle of perfection. Molinos

                </p>
                <p>Men have left their own country, their fathers and mothers, their households and kinsmen and families,
                    and have journeyed from Hind to Sind, making boots of iron until they wore out to shreds, haply to
                    encounter a man having the fragrance of the other world. How many men have died of this sorrow, not
                    succeeding in encountering such a One! As for you, you have encountered such a One here in your own
                    house, and you turn your back on Him. Rumi

                <p>To find or know God in reality by any outward proofs, or by anything but by God himself made manifest
                    and self evident in you, will never be your case either here or hereafter. William Law

                <p>Look within; within is the fountain of all good. Such a fountain, where springing waters can never fail,

                </p>
                <p>The wise, meditating on God, concentrating their thought, discovering in the mouth of the cavern, deeper
                    in the cavern, that Self that ancient Self, difficult to imagine, more difficult to understand, pass

                </p>
                <p>'I am' itself is God. The seeking itself is God. In seeking you discover that you are neither body nor
                    mind, but the love of the Self in you for the Self in all. The two are one. The consciousness in you and
                    the consciousness in me, apparently two, really one, seek unity and that is love. Nisargadatta

                <p>God dwells in the inmost heart of man. We shall find Him within ourselves, if we will only enter in and

                <p>The Inner Light is beyond praise and blame; like space it knows no boundaries, yet it is even here,
                    within us, ever retaining its serenity and fullness. It is only when you hunt for it that you lose it;
                    you cannot take hold of it, but equally you cannot get rid of it, and while you can do neither, it goes
                    on its own way. Yung-Chia Ta-shih
                </p>
                <p>Thus all concentrates: let us not rove; let us sit at home with the cause. Let us stun and astonish the

                <p>Caste, creed, family and lineage do not exist in Brahman. Brahman has neither name nor form, transcends

                <p>Though God is everywhere present, yet he is only present to thee in the deepest and most central part of
                    thy soul. This depth is called the centre, the fund or bottom of the soul. This depth is the unity, the
                    eternity — I had almost said the infinity — of thy soul; for it is so infinite that nothing can satisfy
                    it or give it rest but the infinity of God. William Law

                <p>It is as if, in the middle of one's being, there were a non-being. The Confucians call it the centre of
                    emptiness; the Buddhists, the terrace of life; the Taoists, the ancestral land, or the yellow castle, or
                    the dark pass, or the space of former heaven. Secret of the Golden Flower

                <p>“I am God” is an expression of great humility. The man who says “I am the slave of God” affirms two
                    existences, his own and God’s, but he that says “I am God” has made himself non-existent and has given
                    himself up, and says “I am naught, He is all: there is no being but God’s.” This is extreme humility and
                    self-abasement. Rumi

                <p>The originally existing Unborn — all of you, be sure you don't conceal it from yourselves! This Unborn

                </p>
                <p>The Buddha Mind, unborn and marvellously illuminating, is like a bright mirror. A mirror reflects
                    whatever is in front of it. It's not deliberately trying to reflect things. Likewise, when the object
                    being reflected is removed, the mirror isn't trying not to reflect it, but when it's taken away it
                    doesn't appear in the mirror. The Unborn Buddha Mind is just like this. Bankei

                    down. This alone is permanent, free, eternal, unchanging. It is nothing, Emptiness, mere Clarity. Yes,
                    but it is a Nothing with a difference — a Nothing that's aware of itself as Nothing, and as Everything!

                <p>That you may have pleasure in everything, seek pleasure in nothing. That you may know everything, seek

                <p>Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abides alone: but if it die, it brings forth

                <p>And in that Love which is wayless, we shall wander and stray, and it shall lead us and lose us in the
                    immeasurable breadth of the love of God. And herein we shall flee forth and flee out of ourselves, into
                    the unknown raptures of the goodness and riches of God. And therein we shall melt and be melted away,
                    and shall eternally wander and sojourn within the glory of God. For the contemplative life cannot be
                    taught. But where the eternal Truth reveals itself within the Spirit all that is needful is taught and

                <p>Till now we have worked from the outside on what is within; now we tarry in the centre and rule what is

                <p>Generally, mystic authors write according to their own experience as if the same instructions would
                    serve indefinitely for all others. Whereas such is the inexplicable variety of internal dispositions,

                <p>God leads every soul by a separate path, and you will scarcely meet with one spirit which agrees with

                <p>Such a soul (one who has forgotten itself in God) is not blinded to its own faults or indifferent to its
                    own errors; it is more conscious of them than ever, and increased light shows them in plainer form, but
                    this self-knowledge comes from God, and therefore it is not restless or uneasy. Fenelon
                </p>
                <p>In contemplation God teaches the soul very quietly and secretly, without its knowing how, without the
                    sound of words, and without the help of any bodily or spiritual faculty, in silence and quietude, in
                    darkness to all sensory and natural things. Some spiritual persons call this contemplative knowing by
                    unknowing. St John of the Cross

                    comes to go deeper and (wonder of wonders!) this going deeper in all the great mystical traditions is a
                    passage to the ordinary. William Johnston
                </p>
                <p>Our advance in the practice of spirituality is the gradual increase of the habit of living in the
                    spirit, not in the flesh, — that is, identifying our real self with the ‘point of the soul,’ not with
                    the emotions and imaginations. Dom John Chapman
                </p>
                <p>The whole of the spiritual life is lived backwards. There is no visible progress henceforward, no room
                    for self-congratulation; only more and more distrust of self and confidence in God. Dom John Chapman
                </p>
                <p>The final experience is the annihilation of our human self, of its good qualities as well as its evil;
                    it is ‘dying daily’ until even the best of humanhood is gone, and spiritual identity is revealed. Joel
                    Goldsmith

                <p>No soul can have rest until it finds created things are empty. Julian of Norwich</p>
                <p>In God's sight we do not fall; in our sight we do not stand. As I see it both of these are true. But the
                    deeper insight belongs to God. Julian of Norwich
                </p>
                <p>I know full well that the more the soul sees of God, the more it desires him. Julian of Norwich</p>
                <p>In a sense, admittedly, it's the easiest thing in the world to see what nobody else can see, namely what
                    it's like to be Oneself. But in another sense it's the most difficult thing in the world to see and to
                    go on seeing. Of all ambitions this is the most far-reaching, and no other adventure is anything like so
                    daring or so difficult — till we see how the difficulty was of our own making. Douglas Harding
                </p>
                <p>We do not turn our attention to finding the obvious Seer but run about analysing the seen. We think
                    there is something hiding Reality which must be destroyed before that Reality is gained. It is
                    ridiculous, a great game of pretending. Ramana Maharishi
                </p>
                <p>The truth of Brahman may be understood intellectually. But (even in those who so understand) the desire
                    for personal separation is deep-rooted and powerful, for it exists from beginningless time. It creates
                    the notion, ‘I am the actor, I am he who experiences’. This notion is the cause of bondage to
                    conditional existence, birth and death. It can be removed only by the earnest effort to live constantly
                    in union with Brahman. Shankara
                </p>
                <p>For even so a man that takes a journey, if he holds to one sure road, shall quickly make an end of his
                    journey and of his toil. But if he is essaying many roads, he wanders and makes never an end of his
                    toil, because of such wandering there is no end. William of St Mary
                </p>
                <p>The only thing that matters is the ‘fine point’ of the soul, and you have to learn to live by that, and
                    not by feelings, even of the most spiritual kind. Our Lord will strip you of all this spirituality,
                    until you not only are sure you have no spiritual life, but also know that you ought not even to wish
                    for it! It must be enough for you to be exactly in the state in which God puts you, — that is, in the
                    state in which you find yourself. Dom John Chapman
                </p>
                <p>Forgetful man suffers from illusorily feeling himself abandoned by God, while he is in reality God
                    himself. Benoit
                </p>
                <p>When by grace our courteous Lord shows Himself to our soul, then we have what we desire and for the time
                    we see nothing more to pray for, for all our mind and strength is gathered up in the sight of Him. This
                    is a high, unimaginable prayer. Julian of Norwich
                </p>
                <p>When I am one with that wherein are all things, past, present and to come, all the same distance and all
                    just the same, then they are all in God and all in me. When praying for someone, for Henry or Conrad, I
                    pray at my weakest. When praying for no one I pray at my strongest, and when I want nothing and make no
                    request I am praying at my best, for in God is no Henry or Conrad. Eckhart
                </p>
                <p>To pray like this (simply and humbly) is to remain by faith in the presence of God, with a hidden, but
                    constant desire to receive his grace according to our needs. De Caussade
                </p>
                <p>Remember that the proper result of contemplative prayer is simplicity — so that the contemplative is
                    always doing the same thing all day and all night. He is praying, or having breakfast, or talking, or
                    working, or amusing himself; but he is principally conscious that he is doing God's will; the different
                    external activities seem to him a sort of varied outcome of one continuous internal intention. Dom John
                    Chapman
                </p>
                <p>According to Buddhism, ultimate and unconditioned love can only be achieved through a realisation of
                    Voidness. Because there are no sentient beings to be pitied, Buddha has the greatest pity; because from
                    the very beginning no sentient beings ever existed, Buddha ‘came down’ to earth to save sentient beings.

                <p>Emptiness equals compassion. Buddhist saying</p>
                <p>Having realised that I am one with and yet beyond the world, I became free from all desire and fear.
                    Spontaneity became a way of life, the real became natural and the natural became real. And, above all,
                    infinite affection, love, dark and quiet, radiating in all directions, embracing all, making all
                    interesting and beautiful, significant and auspicious. Nisargadatta

                <p>Those who speak ill of me are really my good friends. When, being slandered, I cherish neither enmity

                <p>Up then, noble soul! Put on your jumping shoes which are intellect and love, and overleap the worship of
                    your mental powers, overleap your understanding and spring into the heart of God. Eckhart
                </p>
                <p>It is the nature of the mind to wander. You are not the mind. The mind springs up and sinks down. It is
                    impermanent, transitory, whereas you are eternal. To inhere in the Self is the thing. Never mind the
                    mind. In the realised man the mind may be active or inactive, the Self alone remains for him. Ramana
                    Maharshi
                </p>
                <p>To attempt to think of the Self which is beyond the range of thought is only to create a new thought.
                    Abandoning such a thought, I abide in peace. Ashtavakra Gita
                </p>
                <p>The soul that is attached to anything, however much good there may be in it, will not arrive at the
                    liberty of divine union. St John of the Cross
                </p>
                <p>He that seeks no witness for himself without, has clearly committed himself wholly unto God. Thomas a
                    Kempis
                </p>
                <p>It is the nature of abandonment always to lead a mysterious life, and to receive great and miraculous
                    gifts from God by means of the most ordinary things, things that may be natural, accidental, or that
                    seem to happen by chance, and in which there seems no other agency than the ordinary course of the ways
                    of the world. This is why abandoned souls carefully gather up the crumbs that sceptics trample
                    underfoot. Everything is precious in their eyes, everything enriches them. They are inexpressibly
                    indifferent towards all things, and yet neglect nothing, having respect for, and making use of all
                    things. De Caussade
                </p>
                <p>There is no end to our willing and longing until we know God in the fullness of joy. Julian of Norwich
                </p>
                <p>And I tell you, by the eternal truth, that so long as you desire to fulfil the will of God and have any
                    hankering after eternity and God, for just so long you are not truly poor. He alone has true spiritual
                    poverty who wills nothing, knows nothing, desires nothing. Eckhart
                </p>
                <p>Others gain authority over you if you possess a will distinct from God's will. Rabbi Hahman of
                    Bratzlav
                </p>
                <p>If we understood how to see in each moment some manifestation of the will of God we should find therein

                <p>Surrender to your own Self, of which everything is an expression. Nisargadatta</p>
                <p>Perfection consists in doing the will of God, not in understanding his designs. De Caussade</p>
                <p>Generally, one has to go on keeping the imagination quiet. But there is the curious feeling that these
                    imaginations are not you — they are mechanical, like those in a dream. You leave them as nearly
                    uncontrolled as possible, in order to have the will fixed on nothing in particular — which is God, of
                    course. Dom John Chapman
                </p>
                <p>One lives in perpetual doubt and ignorance what God's will is going to be, but not what it is at this
                    individual moment: that we always know, because it is. Dom John Chapman
                </p>
                <p>The whole of man is the Whole: nothing less is viable. However you look at him, then, whether from
                    inside or outside, he is (in the last resort) that all-inclusive One which organises the diverse wills
                    of all its members into One will which we call God's will — which is none other than your will when you
                    know Who you really are and what you really want, when you are all there and wholly yourself. Seeming to
                    yourself and others to be a part of the Universe, you intend that part; being all of it, you intend it
                    all. Douglas Harding

                <p>His will is our peace. Dante</p>

                <p>When the Ten Thousand things are viewed in their oneness, we return to the Origin and remain where we
                    have always been. Sen t’san
                </p>
                <p>You must love God as not-God, not-Spirit, not-person, not-image, but as He is, a sheer, pure absolute
                    One, sundered from all two-ness, and in whom we must eternally sink from nothingness to nothingness.

                <p>The sudden perception that Subject and object are one will lead to a deeply mysterious wordless

                <p>Though One, Brahman is the cause of the many. There is no other cause. Shankara</p>
                <p>As waves, foam and bubbles are not different from water, so in the light of true knowledge, the
                    Universe, born of the Self, is not different from the Self. Ashtavakra Gita
                </p>
                <p>An essential work is when the essence of the soul is one and simple, and is placed in complete silence.
                    And through simplicity it has communion with all things; for what is most simple is most universal, and
                    imparts itself to all things, and yet remains undivided and unmoved in itself. John Tauler
                </p>
                <p>One is the alone not by way of exclusion but by way of inclusion. Douglas Harding</p>

                <p>The timeless realm of absolute unity is the realm where no distinction made apparent in time is lost.
                    And here alone are fulfilled the conditions of love. Love demands that the loved one shall be himself
                    and free; and love demands union. In the world of time these requirements are incompatible, and love is
                    always working its own undoing. But in the timeless world they are realised together — the perfection of
                    independence and of oneness do not cancel out, but reinforce each other. In Hell I am bent on finding
                    myself in myself, but time destroys me; in Heaven I am bent on losing myself in another, but eternity
                    preserves me. Douglas Harding
                </p>
                <p>There is no chaos in the world except the chaos which your mind creates. It is self-created in the sense
                    that at its very centre is the false idea of oneself as a thing different and separate from other
                    things. In reality you are not a thing separate from other things. You are the infinite potentiality,
                    the inexhaustible possibility. Because you are, all can be. The universe is but a partial manifestation
                    of your limitless capacity to become. Nisargadatta
                </p>
                <p>Everyone who attaches importance to the external becomes internally without resource. Chuang-tzu</p>
                <p>We are inflicting a grievous wound upon the world and it's bleeding to death from that wound. We have
                    split it into two unequal fragments called OURSELF and THE REST, or ME and NOT ME. The result is that we
                    have on our hands not a Universe but a Duoverse, a Duality and no Unity. And it's hardly surprising that
                    the severed parts should be deficient, tragically and incurably sick, so long as the dreadful wound
                    isn't closed and healed. Douglas Harding

                <p>To sit in the Throne of God is to inhabit Eternity. To reign there is to be pleased with all things in

                <p>You never enjoy the World aright, till you see all things in it so perfectly yours, that you cannot

                <p>All knowledge is what constitutes the essence of Buddhahood. It does not mean that the Buddha knows

                <p>Observe again how empty this country is, how there's nothing at all where you are, nothing to keep
                    things out with; and how nevertheless this emptiness is its filling, how this Space is truly enriched
                    with all its contents. This alone is true ownership. In Heaven you incorporate the universe, precisely
                    because you are incorporeal. Douglas Harding
                </p>
                <p>You never enjoy the world aright till the sea itself floweth in your veins, till you are clothed with
                    the heavens and crowned with the stars; and perceive yourself to be the sole heir of the whole world.
                    Traherne

                <p>Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. St Paul</p>
                <p>The treasure of treasures for the soul is to pass from the something into this Nothingness from which
                    anything can be born. Boehme
                </p>
                <p>A state of alert naivete is required. Douglas Harding</p>
                <p>The goods of God, which are beyond all measure, can only be contained in an empty and solitary heart. St
                    John of the Cross
                </p>
                <p>And in the light of love and with inward observation, the wise man will taste of the multitude of
                    consolations and good things; and will not rest upon any flower of the gifts of God, but, laden with
                    gratitude and praise, will fly back into the unity, wherein he wishes to rest and to dwell eternally
                    with God. Ruysbroeck
                </p>
                <p>Become pure till you neither are nor have this or that; then you are omnipresent and, being neither this
                    nor that, are all things. Eckhart
                </p>
                <p>To lose all is to gain all. Anandamayi Ma</p>
                <p>Every soul which flees away from poverty and nonexistence is misfortune fleeing away from prosperity and
                    good fortune. Rumi
                </p>
                <p>Behind my work was ambition, behind my love was personality, behind my purity was fear, behind my
                    guidance the thirst for power. Now they are vanishing and I drift. I come, floating wheresoever Thou
                    takest me — in the voiceless, in the strange, in the wonderland. Vivekananda
                </p>
                <p>Only I am in a position to report on what's here. A kind of alert naivete is what I need. It takes an
                    innocent eye and an empty head (not to mention a stout heart) to admit their own perfect emptiness.

                <p>Emptiness functions mysteriously, vacuity works wonders. Te-shan</p>
                <p>When you abide in the Unborn, you abide at the source of all Buddhas; so it’s something wonderfully
                    precious. There is no question of ‘perishing’ here, so when you abide in the Unborn, it's superfluous to
                    speak about the Imperishable. What isn't created can't be destroyed. Bankei
                </p>
                <p>He that beholds his own Face — his light is greater than the light of the creatures. Though he die, his
                    sight is everlasting, because his sight is the sight of the Creator. Rumi
                </p>
                <p>Science rules out all religion except the highest. Douglas Harding</p>
                <p>Every visible and invisible creature is a theophany, an appearance of God. Erigena</p>
                <p>Face there to No-face here – you are busted wide-open for the other. You are built for loving. Next time
                    you are with someone, see that this is true. This is the foundation of love
                </p>
                <p>Listen. Sounds arising now, from this Silence. Sounds appearing, in this Silence. Sounds dissolving back
                    into this Silence – into the mysterious, wonderful, awesome Silence of your own Being – of Being Itself.
                </p>
                <p>Attend to your breathing.The sensation of the in-breath, the sensation of the out-breath. Notice that
                    this movement, this rhythm, occurs in this breathless Stillness, in this boundless aware Space that you
                    are and are not.
                </p>
                <p>Point out. You are pointing at things. Thousands of things. Form and colour. Motion. Coming and going.
                    Point in. No-thing. One. Shapeless and transparent. Still. Always here. And where, may I ask, is the
                    dividing line between inside and outside? I find none.
                </p>
                <p>Have you ever looked out of anything but this wondrous Single Eye? This Eye that is Wide-Eyed, Open,
                    Edgeless. That contains the world. Or rather, is the world. This is not a human eye. It is divine. This
                    is the Eye of the One, the always-open Eye of God.
                </p>
                <p>Nearer to you right now than your hands and feet, closer than your breathing, your side of all your
                    thoughts and feelings, is this… Ah, no words are adequate. No words can describe This. And no words are
                    needed. This is Who we are.
                </p>
                <p>What a relief from the complications of the world and thought when we expand our attention to include
                    the Absent Looker, the Absent Thinker – this simple Silence. Now all those things, all those thoughts,
                    are viewed from and in this Simplicity, this Clarity, this Peace.
                </p>
                <p>Notice any object in front of you. Be aware that it is one thing amongst many things. Listen to any
                    sound and notice that it arises with other sounds. Attend to the sensation of your foot, say, and
                    recognise it is given in the wider field of sensation. Now be aware of Who you really are. Are You
                    positioned alongside others? Do you exist with others? Are you in a crowd of Awarenesses? Are you one
                    amongst many? I am not. As this Single-eyed One, I am Alone. There is nothing and no-one outside me.
                    Nothing apart from me, up against me. All are within this Space, this Awareness, this One. Are you the
                    same? When you attend, do you not find that you are the One that contains the Many?
                </p>
                <p>Walking down the corridor, notice you do not move – the corridor moves through you. Driving, see how the
                    world flows through you. You are the stillness at the heart of the turning world.
                </p>
                <p>What is ‘seeing Who you are’ Notice you cannot see your face – this is it. Instead of your face you see
                    the world. This is a non-verbal experience. It is simply true. What it means to you will be unique to
                    you. Each person responds to this Common Reality in their own way. Vive la difference!
                </p>
                <p>Notice your Single Eye. Every individual thing you look at is inside an environment, surrounded by other
                    things, contained inside something bigger. But is your Single Eye contained? Not in my experience. It
                    floats magically in Nothingness, in boundless Consciousness. Every individual thing you look at is
                    bigger or smaller than the things around it, but how big is your Single Eye? I find no second Eye to
                    compare it with. It is Single. It is Incomparable. I cannot say how big it is. Or rather, I cannot say
                    how big I am. I am unconfined and free. I am unlimited. What freedom and joy to be this One.
                </p>
                <p>If you are inside a room, notice you cannot see all four walls at once. There’s always a wall, or part
                    of a wall, missing. Where you are is Great Space. Being confined or imprisoned in a room would mean you
                    are surrounded by four walls, a ceiling and a floor. But for me, one wall is missing. I am not in this
                    room, this room is in me. Is this true for you? Are you in the world, or is the world in you? Enjoy your
                    Freedom!
                </p>
                <p>This moment is emerging magically, miraculously, out of the Clear Space, the Emptiness, the Great
                    Storehouse. Moment by moment. This moment – things there appearing in the No-thing here.
                </p>
                <p>Things come from things, but where does No-thing come from? The many come from the One, but where does
                    the One come from? No answer! A mystery to be lived. A miracle to be celebrated.
