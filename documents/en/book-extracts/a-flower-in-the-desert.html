        <h1>From 'A Flower In The Desert'</h1>

        <div class="author">by David Lang</div>

        <p>I am lying in bed, slowly waking. I don't know the time, but I can tell by the two pale rectangles of light
            glimmering in the darkness that dawn is near. In the distance, I hear the sound of a train.
        </p>

        <p>Distance? An assumption. The rolling, rumbling sound, small and faint, vibrates in the silence of this
            room.
        </p>

        <p>Lying in bed? A convenient lie. For in the darkness, among these warm and comfortable sensations, no bed or
            body
            appears. Beyond these thoughts, no mind governs.
        </p>

        <p>I reach out my hand, searching for my watch on the floor. By its battery light, I see it is six o'clock. I
            have
            an hour before my family wakes — time to write these words.
        </p>

        <p>At this moment, three paths are crossing. Three? Yes, three. For besides your path, which beyond the pages of
            this book forks into your past and future, unknown to me, and besides my path, selected bits of which
            glimmer in
            the darkness between the pages ahead, there is a third, broad path upon which we can travel together. It
            stretches from this book in front of you to You and from my computer screen in front of me to Me. Not such a
            long path, eh? And not particularly interesting, either, you might think. But — forgive me —you
            would be wrong. For here is a path showered with more magic than the most fantastic fairytale. Step onto
            this
            one-foot-long path, and you can walk all the way to infinity. Pass through this mild countryside, and you
            will
            encounter such dangers as will challenge you to risk, and lose, your life. Arrive, both dead and alive, at
            your
            destination, and you will find that your end is your beginning, and that you have never left, since even
            before
            you were born, this marvelous home.
        </p>

        <p>What end? What beginning?</p>

        <p>The answers fork into paradox and vanish below the horizon of words.</p>

        <p>“But look,” I say, “over here. How clear the sky! How beautiful the view!”</p>

        <p>But I am getting ahead of myself. Come. Let us go together. The door is open.</p>
