        <h1>Pointing Experiment</h1>
        <p>A step-by-step way of guiding your attention to the formless centre of yourself…</p>
        <img src="../../../common/images/experiments/pointing-1.jpg" />
        <p>Point at something in front of you. You see a thing there. Notice its form and colour.</p>
        <img src="../../../common/images/experiments/pointing-2.jpg" />
        <p>Point at your shoe. Notice its form and colour. Another thing.</p>
        <img src="../../../common/images/experiments/pointing-3.jpg" />
        <p>Point at your knee – another thing.</p>
        <img src="../../../common/images/experiments/pointing-4.jpg" />
        <p>Point at your torso – yet another thing.</p>
        <img src="../../../common/images/experiments/pointing-5.jpg" />
        <p>Now point at where others see your face – the place you are looking out of. What do you see at zero distance?
            Do you see your face? Do you see anything at all?
        </p>
        <p>I see no face here. Instead I see space, emptiness… This space is now filled with my finger, plus the rest of
            the room, sounds, sensations, thoughts… From my point of view I am not a limited thing – I am boundless
            capacity for the world.
        </p>
        <p>What do you find? Are you also capacity for the world?</p>
