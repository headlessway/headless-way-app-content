        <h1>Touching Your No-Head</h1>
        <p>“But I can touch my head!”</p>
        <p>Hold your hands out in front of you.</p>
        <img src="../../../common/images/experiments/touch-1.jpg" />
        <p>Move them towards yourself and touch your head. You feel something. Going by present evidence, not memory or
            imagination, does this ‘something’ have colour or shape? How big is it? How solid? Is it a ‘thing’?
        </p>
        <img src="../../../common/images/experiments/touch-2.jpg" />
        <p>Do the sensations you feel occur on the surface of your head or in boundless, awake emptiness? Are you
            touching your head or your no-head?
        </p>
        <img src="../../../common/images/experiments/touch-3.jpg" />
        <p>My sensations are in this awake emptiness just as everything is in this awake emptiness.</p>
        <p>Of course I’ve learned to connect these invisible sensations to the head I see in the mirror – I see my hands
            touching my head there in the mirror and imagine they are touching the same thing here, though I cannot see
            anything here. I learned to do this as a child. Associating the touch sensations here with the image there
            is a vital part of growing up. However, I never see my hands touching my head here – I see them disappearing
            and then I feel sensation. From my point of view, all these sensations are happening in space here, not in a
            head. What I am for others, a person with a head, is the opposite of what I am for myself – headless space
            for sensation.
        </p>
        <p>First be aware of your experience, then make sense of it to society – rather than first accept what society
            says and then suppress your experience to fit in with society’s view. Only you are where you are – no one
            but you has the authority to say what you are at zero distance.
        </p>
        <p>When I try and make sense of the difference between what I am for others and what I am for myself, I
            recognise that to see the world I need my head, my eyes, my brain, and the cells, molecules and particles
            they are made of. (I also need the atmosphere, the sun, the galaxy…) All these layers are involved in my
            seeing. But I am not seeing from these layers – I see with and through them from my centre – from this
            self-evidently aware space. <span class="underlined">What</span> I am aware of is affected
            by the state of each of these layers, <span class="underlined">that</span> I am aware is
            not. It is not a conditioned person (or brain, or cell, or particle) at centre who is aware but the
            unconditioned One. In reality, only God sees the stars, hears the wind, greets a friend…
