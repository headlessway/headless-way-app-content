        <h1>Looking Into Time From The Timeless</h1>
        <img src="../../../common/images/experiments/time-1.jpg" />
        <p>Look at your watch. There is the face of time. The hands move, marking out the passing of the minutes and
            hours. All is change there.
        </p>
        <p>Look in at yourself – at your no face. No wrinkles here marking the passing of the hours, or days or years.
            There’s no change here – no age to this One.
        </p>
        <p>Bring your watch right up to you – it disappears. Time there gives way to the timeless here.</p>
        <img src="../../../common/images/experiments/time-2.jpg" />
        <p>Point at a clock face with one index finger and at your timeless no-face with the other. Time there to no
            time here.
        </p>
        <p>All things bear the marks of time. Things get worn down, crack and break, faces get wrinkles, bodies stiffen,
            eyes don’t see so well, ears don’t hear so well… But do you find any of the marks of time where you are? I
            don’t. My no-face is as wrinkle-free now as the day I was born. Or not born! My no-body is still perfectly
            flexible, my single Eye perfectly clear…
        </p>
        <p>In any moment – in this moment – you can notice you are looking into time from the timeless.</p>
