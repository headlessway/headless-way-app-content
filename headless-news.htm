<p><strong>Online Workshop Sunday 19 September</strong></p>

<p>With Richard Lang</p>

<p>&quot;This is like studying Non-Dual meditation but without the pain in the butt of long sitting meditation as many of the experiments are active and interactive. Well worth attending if there is another opportunity. Great workshop and well presented.&quot;</p>

<p>Headless Way is growing in popularity as an astonishingly simple way to notice fundamental truths about your experience, which for some people can be both thrilling and liberating.</p>

<p>Sunday 19 September 2021</p>

<p>7pm - 9pm UK Time (UTC +01:0)</p>

<p><strong>The Youniverse Explorer&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><small>3 August 2021</small></p>

<p>The Youniverse Explorer model is now back on sale.</p>

<p>This edition of the model comes fully assembled. Originally designed by Douglas Harding in the 1970s, this is a new model of our place in the universe. It is important in terms of a new view of who we are in the same way as the first photograph of the Earth from the Moon was important and inspiring, or the first model of the solar system. This model, however, includes every layer or ourselves, including the Centre. Not only is this a work of genius, bringing together every level of our body and mind into one model, but it is also beautiful, a work of art. We have about 200 hundred of these amazing models for sale. (They stand about 35 cm tall.) This is likely to be the last time we produce this model. Certainly a collector&#39;s item!</p>
